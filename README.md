## Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients based on various medical features. By leveraging various classification algorithms, we aim to predict whether a patient has CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) or not. This can be a valuable tool for medical professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making, potentially saving lives by identifying high-risk individuals.

## Goal
## Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the kidney disease dataset to handle missing values, correct data inconsistencies, and transform categorical variables into numerical ones.
## Model Development: 
Train various machine learning models to predict CKD (class 0) or non-CKD (class 1).
## Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
## Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Improve model performance using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
## Deployment: 
Once the best performing model is identified, it will be deployed for real-time predictions.
## Models Used
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is used to classify the data based on the proximity of feature vectors to labeled instances. It helps in identifying patterns in medical data.

Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
A Decision Tree is built by splitting the data into branches to predict outcomes. It helps in visualizing decision-making paths based on medical features.

Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
Random Forest uses an ensemble of decision trees for prediction, reducing overfitting and providing a more robust solution.

AdaBoost Classifier
AdaBoost combines multiple weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. It is effective in reducing bias and improving accuracy.

Gradient Boosting Classifier
Gradient Boosting builds models in a sequential manner to correct errors made by previous models, making it a powerful ensemble learning method.

Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB)
SGB improves upon Gradient Boosting by adding randomness in model fitting, which can help reduce overfitting.

XGBoost Classifier
XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting algorithm that enhances model performance through parallelization and regularization.
